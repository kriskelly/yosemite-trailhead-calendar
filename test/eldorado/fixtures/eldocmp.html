campground on right.

<STRONG>GENERAL COMMENTS:</STRONG>
The elevation is 5,300 ft.

This campground, near Gerle Creek, began as a gathering place for
off-road enthusiasts.  Today, the campground is more developed
but has retained much of its original character.  It is designed
to accommodate both single families and groups of off-road
vehicles.  This is a nice place for a base camp to explore the
area.  Cedar and pine trees provide some shade and widely spaced
camp sites provide good privacy.  Camp sites 12 through 15 are
best suited for single family campers with pop-up tent campers or
slide-ins.  There are community bear-proof food containers.

This is bear country; practice safe food storage techniques.

NOTE: Main St. becomes Buckeye Lake Rd. (Forest Rt. 1).

<STRONG>GENERAL COMMENTS:</STRONG>
The elevation is 5,300 ft.

The campground has two overlapping loops in a grove of large
cedars, pines and fir trees.  With the grass and fern understory
and dappled shade, the campground has a magical appearance. 
Although the campground has an undiscovered feel to it, the long
drive is well worth it.  The nearby Hell Hole Reservoir offers a
wide range of waterplay activities.  Bear-proof food containers
are found at some camp sites.

This is bear country; practice safe food storage techniques.

<STRONG>GENERAL COMMENTS:</STRONG>
The elevation is 4,800 ft.

This very scenic campground is located on a peninsula jutting out
into Union Valley Reservoir.  Cedar, fir, and mixed pines provide
shade to most camp sites.  Privacy is fair between camp sites. 
Great location for beach and boat sports.  Boats can be moored at
or close to some camp sites.  A grass meadow on one side of
campground stretches out to the reservoir.

This is bear country; practice safe food storage techniques.

The elevation is 7,900 ft.

The campground, located across from Caples Lake, has two loops
connected by a spur in a stand of Lodgepole pine.  It runs up a
draw with rock walls on both sides.  Only a few sites at front of
campground have a partial view of the lake.  The lake is a
pleasant canoe and small sailboat destination.  Kirkwood Mountain
Resort offers a variety of activities including mountain biking
and disc golf plus limited groceries, post office and restaurant.

The campground, developed by the joint efforts of volunteers and

of endurance trail riding.  The campground is located in a grove
of mixed pine, cedar and oak and is comprised of a series of
overlapping loops within a large loop.  It has a rough and rugged
appearance with poorly defined parking aprons and horse manure
scattered all over campground.  Although considered a horse camp,
equestrian facilities provided are limited to a few water
troughs.  Pack it in, pack it out.

<STRONG>GENERAL COMMENTS:</STRONG>
The elevation is 4,900 ft.

This all-tent campground is a delight.  Camp sites are scattered
around a terraced hillside providing almost every site a view of
the Union Valley Reservoir and distant mountains.  There is lots
of shade from a pleasant mixture of conifers.  There is ample
spacing between camp sites to provide fair to good privacy.  The
campground is named for a ranch now under the reservoir.

The campground, located near Gerle Creek and Gerle Reservoir, has
one large loop with another small loop inside it.  Cedar, fir and
a sprinkle of oak provide some shade.  Some camp sites have a
view of the reservoir.  Be sure to bring float toys and sunscreen
for a pleasant day next to the water - lots of places between
boulders to set up lawn chairs.  Community bear-proof food
containers are available and firewood can be purchased.

<STRONG>GENERAL COMMENTS:</STRONG>
The elevation is 5,200 ft.

This tent-only campground is perched on a rim above Hell Hole
Reservoir.  While the reservoir and surrounding vista are hidden
by a dense growth of large Ponderosa pine and cedar, it is but a
short walk to a rock overlook - quite a view.  Quite and
secluded, this campground is far from the crowds and in the
forest.  A small pond is located in the campground - bring insect
repellent.  There are bear-proof food containers at a few of the

<STRONG>GENERAL COMMENTS:</STRONG>
The elevation is 5,500 ft.

The campground has two unnamed sections along the shores of Ice
House Reservoir plus an RV only area at boat ramp.  The first
section is two overlapping loops tucked in among cedar and
Ponderosa pine.  Some camp sites are along the shoreline with a
pleasant view of the reservoir.  The sites in this first section
have minmal privacy.  The second section (on opposite side of
boat ramp) has area for tents only.  The lakeside camp sites are
secluded and attractive.  The remaining portion of this section
is more open with scattered, towering Ponderosa pines, cedars and
large Manzanita bushes.  The interior road in this section is
rough compared to first section.  Firewood is available for a
fee.  The Ice House Resort offers limited groceries, gas, and a
cook's night out.

<STRONG>GENERAL COMMENTS:</STRONG>
The elevation is 7,600 ft.

This delightful single loop tent campground, next to Kirkwood
Lake, is located in a field of glacial-carved rock.  Boulders
located around campground give a protective, fortress type
feeling.  Lodgepole pine and River willow provide ample shade. 
The lake offers pleasant canoeing possibilities.  Nearby
trailheads offer access to Mokelumne Wilderness, but campers may
not want to leave because it is reminiscent of the beauty of New
England's Golden Pond.  The Two Sentinels, standing guard over the
campground is an example of its great vistas.  Kirkwood Mountain
Resort offers a variety of activities including mountain biking
and disc golf plus limited groceries, post office and restaurant.

<STRONG>GENERAL COMMENTS:</STRONG>
The elevation is 4,000 ft.

The Pi Pi (pronounced pie pie) campground has three loops connected 
by long spurs through a pleasant, heavy mixture of conifers, 
including cedar and fir.  It is a pretty campground with excellent 
privacy between campsites that stretches out along the Middle 
Fork of Cosumnes River.  The meadow area was once used by the 
Miwok for summer camping.  Today, the campsites encircle that area.  
The California Door Lumber Co. (provided lumber to San Francisco 
after the devastating San Francisco 1906 earthquake) logged the 
area about 100 years ago.  The campground is a good base camp for 
licensed OHV vehicles for trails starting about a mile from 
campground - contact the ranger district office for trail 
information.

The elevation is 3,900 ft.

The campground is a single loop between South Fork of American
River and US Rt. 50.  A majority of campsites are along the
river.  Both tent sites are walk-in and enjoy the best privacy. 
Cedar and pine provide some shade.  Although riverside campsites
are most popular, the non-river campsites are good for transient,
overnight campers.  Nearby communities of Silver Fork and Kyburz
offer gas and limited groceries.  Firewood is available for a
fee.  Expect some traffic noise from Rt. 50.

4.3 miles to Silverfork campground sign.  Turn right onto Forest
Rt. 7 and go 7.1 miles to campground on left.

<STRONG>GENERAL COMMENTS:</STRONG>
The elevation is 5,500 ft.

The campground has three unnamed loops above the Silver Fork of
American River.  Although a number of camp sites overlook it,
none have "safe" access to the River.  A path near the fee board 
is only access provided.  The sound of the river's rapids can be 
heard throughout the campground.  Mature fir and Jeffrey pine 
provide lots of shade.  Nice level parking aprons at a good angle 
to interior road make this a good RV friendly campground.  Firewood
is available for a fee.

<STRONG>GENERAL COMMENTS:</STRONG>
The elevation is 7,200 ft.

The campground has three unnamed loops connected by a spur
meandering around knolls and through a pleasant mixture of
conifers, including Red fir and Lodgepole pine.  A small pond in
the middle of the campground attracts ducks, but cannot be seen
from any of the camp sites.  The two loops closest to the
campground entrance have less shade but longer parking aprons. 
Silver Lake is within easy walking distance from most camp sites. 
Two nearby resorts offer boat rentals, limited groceries, and a
cook's night out.  Firewood is available for a fee.

This is bear country; practice safe food storage techniques.

The elevation is 5,800 ft.

The campground is a spur leading to a teardrop loop in a mixture
of conifers including cedar and Sugar pine.  It is on a hillside
with a very steep stretch when exiting from the loop.  This may
cause some travel trailers to drag.  The campground is not on
Bear River Reservoir, but some camp sites have a limited view of
the reservoir through the trees.  The nearby Bear River Lake Resort
offers limited groceries and boat rentals.

This is bear country; practice safe food storage techniques.

The campground is a single loop on the north shore of Ice House

The campground has three unnamed sections stretching out on a

overlook the water and all are within walking distance of the
shore.  It is possible to moor a boat along the shoreline. 
Ponderosa pine, cedar, and fir provide ample shade.  The provided
swim beach is nearby at Fashoda Beach campground.  This is a
very popular campground - reservations are recommended for
weekends and holidays.  The first and second sections are rougher
with dense tree growth and eroded parking aprons and interior
road.  The third section has a wider interior road with newer
paved surfaces and is more RV friendly.  Nearby Icehouse Resort

<STRONG>GENERAL COMMENTS:</STRONG>
The elevation is 8,200 ft.

The campground is a large single loop meandering through
Lodgepole pine, fir, and piles of boulders.  Several small ponds
dot the campground.  These characteristics and the understory of
grass and wildflowers give the campground a cool lush feeling. 
Woods Lake, within an easy walk of the campground, offers
pleasant canoeing.  Numerous trails offer different levels of
hiking with some accessing Mokulemne Wilderness.  The campground
is well suited for tent campers and small RVs.

<STRONG>DIRECTIONS:</STRONG>
In Pollock Pines, CA, at intersection of US Rt. 50 and Sly Park
Rd, take Rt. 50 east 8.3 miles to Crystal Basin Recreation Area
sign.  Turn left at sign onto Icehouse Rd and go 10.8 miles to
Ice House Reservoir sign.  Turn right and go 1.1 miles to
Wright's Lake sign.  Turn left and go 7.6 miles to a "T"
intersection.  Turn left onto Wrights Lake Rd (Forest Rt. 4) and
go 1.8 miles to campground.

<STRONG>GENERAL COMMENTS:</STRONG>
The elevation is 6,900 ft.

The campground, near the Desolation Wilderness, has three unnamed
sections - one tent only, one equestrian, and one for tents and
RVs (combined).  The tent-only section loops through a stand of
Lodgepole pine and fir near Wrights Lake.  Many camp sites in
this section have a view of the lake.  Wildflowers and grass
provide a pleasing understory, but little privacy.  Only a few
camp sites tucked in among boulders do have nice privacy.

The combined section has three overlapping loops in what was once
a meadow but now has a stand of young Lodgepole pine providing
shade to most camp sites.  This section has several walk-in tent
sites, and along with rest of the section, minimal privacy. 
Close to the campground's amphitheater and Twin Lakes Trailhead,
it is a walk to Wrights Lake.

The equestrian section, for horse campers only, is a large loop
just before the campground's entrance.  This section circles a
grassy meadow with some camp sites adjacent to South Fork Silver
Creek.  Lodgepole pine provide some shade.  There are no tethers,
corrals or watering troughs.

Overall, this is an excellent, attractive campground.  The lake
is a wonderful, quiet place to explore with inflatable rafts,
kayakes, canoes, etc.  Swimming, although not provided by the
Forest Service, is an ongoing activity.  Reservations are
recommended for tent-only and combined sections.

This is bear country; practice safe food storage techniques.
